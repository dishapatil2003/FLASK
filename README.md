Todo App := 
   A simple and intuitive Todo App built with Flask, Python, and SQLAlchemy. This app allows users to manage their tasks efficiently, with features for adding, editing, and deleting tasks. The project is designed to help you learn how to build a full-stack web application using Flask as the backend framework and SQLAlchemy as the ORM for interacting with a SQL database.


Features:
   Add new tasks: Create new todo items by specifying a title and description.
   Update tasks:  Edit or update tasks with new information.
   Delete tasks:  Remove tasks from the list.


Technologies Used := 
   Flask: A lightweight Python web framework for handling routing and requests.
   SQLAlchemy: An ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) to interact with the SQL database, making database operations easier to manage.
   SQLite: The default SQL database used for local storage, but can be switched to other databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) with minor configuration changes.
   HTML/CSS: Basic front-end styling and layout for displaying tasks

Prerequisites :=
  Python
  Virtual environment (optional but recommended)
